# Processes for development(based on SCRUM framework)

Because our teams consist of volunteers, we are using modified SCRUM framework. We can't call it as SCRUM, but to have simple processes description we'll call it SCRUM or lite-SCRUM.

**Each vote is important, if you have an idea, please suggest.**

## Teams 

We have several teams, people are distributed for teams by technology stack and skills. In general, we have theese teams:
1. Frontend developers
2. Python developers
3. .NET developers

Each team can choose a leader, but it's not necessary. 

## Product team

The project provides a manager for each team. He is responsible for:
1. Preparing requirements for features
2. Ordering team backlog
3. Syncronize team with other teams
4. Continious improvements
5. Resolving blockers

Also, project has Infrastructure engineer, technical leader, designers. 
All of these makes **Product team**.

## Lifecycle

The point of launching **release is not defined** now, it'll be found by Product team.

Each new team has a **dynamic sprint duration**. At the point of creation it will be *2 weeks*. 
But, it can be changed by team, because team members can have additional activities, study processes, exams, competitions. 
It can affect sprint goal, so to reach it, the team can choose sprint length before start it.

The result of any sprint is **product increment**, it's a particle which makes our project better. It can be a source code, or just knowledges. 

### Sprint planning

The team has a discussion about what we can do in this sprint to make our project better.
After sprint planning the team should have answers:
1. How much is your sprint duration? (2 weeks, 1 month etc.)
2. What is a goal of your sprint? (Provide new feature.... Learn ...)
3. When will be a sprint review meeting? (see below)

That answers should be **shared between all teams**. You can use project chat and template for it.

```
Команда <Название> начинает очередной спринт.
Цель спринта: реализовать функцию загрузки файлов
Длина спринта: 1 месяц
Дата ревью: 05.06.2023
```

### Sprint review

For sprint review the team should **make a meeting which are opened for all**. Durning the meeting the team represents results. For example:
```
Целью этого спринта было показать пользователю список событий клуба. Мы не успели полностью закончить эту фичу, так как столкнулись с дефектами:
1. Дефект А
2. Дефект Б

Сейчас я включу демонстрацию экрана и покажу, что на данный момент работает.
```

### Short scrum meeting

The reason of having it to **syncronize team members** between they.
New team has it twice a week, but frequency can be increased or reduced. Depends on load of developers, it's not a full time project. 


### Refinement meeting

The team can invite stakeholders(potencial users of feature) and Product team to this meeting and ask questions. 
For example:
```
1. Для этой фичи мы подготовили два макета, давайте обсудим и выберем какой лучше.
2. Мы столкнулись с проблемой и нам нужна помощь, чтоб её решить
```
